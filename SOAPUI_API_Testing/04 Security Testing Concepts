SQL injection: testing is created to validate that the queries used by the application does not allow the use
               of general expression as the value of a userID, Like: 
               select * from login_table where password='password' and userId = 'pds%'. the % is for general
               expression. hackers normally use % general expressions method. they hack the query sent to the 
               server and inject the % general expression. This a leakage because the backend developer must 
               writes the query that DOES NOT allow % regular expression use.
               As tester we have to make sure that the application does not allow these SQL injection leakage.
